# Overlays.zip File

This file should contain your overlay files structured as described in OVERLAYS-ZIP-STRUCTURE.md.

Currently, the application will show demo overlays when Overlays.zip is not found or fails to load.

To add real overlays:
1. Create overlay folders (e.g., wizard_hat, cool_glasses)
2. Add slim.png and normal.png to each folder
3. ZIP all folders into Overlays.zip
4. Place Overlays.zip in this directory

The application will automatically detect and extract overlays from the ZIP file.
